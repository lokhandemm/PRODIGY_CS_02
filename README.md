# Image Encryption & Decryption using Python 🖼️🔐 
                      
This project provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt images using NumPy and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). The encryption process applies a shift operation  to pixel values, making the image unreadable without the correct key.

## Features 🚀
- Encrypts an image by shifting pixel values.
- Decrypts an encrypted image back to its original form.
- Supports user input for selecting encryption or decryption. 
- Works with grayscale and color images.
